## My very first proyect!

The idea really came to be as the first proyect assignment from [The Odin Proyect](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes), wich, usless to say, I'm following daily, deeply in love with it.
Since it is, at is core, not a tutorial, that give some room to make my own take on it.
The Odin objective was simple, and afterwards I found out that most solutions were mostly plain blank html files, or they implemented some CSS to it.
So I really wanted to give myself the constrain to work only with HTML, and make something that weren't just a few links and some text, but at the same time use HTML only.

## The inspiration

I looked trough the internet to some Old School sites and really found out some inspiration there, mostly coming from [SpaceJam Website](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/),
really love the design idea, and started looking to the implementation, mostly inspecting the DOM. So that way I found they cleverly used Table Cells to align everything, plus the, nowadays depracated ```align=""``` property.


## Targeted Objectives

✅ No CSS
✅ Accessible from Mobile
✅ Multiple pages
✅ 'To the top' link
✅ Pleasently looking background
✅ 90's vibe.
